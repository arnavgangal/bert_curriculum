32	d995c0aba08d44bb50bff25f9	This film was a big treat.<br /><br />I take the opposite view of the critics . This is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors ; here the material and actors ( Bette Davis and James Cagney ) are merely beyond any level established . Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were every bit as big as Davis and Cagney , and look how It Happened one Night turned out - an all - time classic . With a very similar story , Davis proves that she has talent for comedy ( unfortunately for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted ! ) Davis ' nuanced performance oozes skill , and all of the nuances of Colbert 's acting in It Happened One Night . Cagney , World_Health_Organization was a great comedy actor , just look on point with his costar , Davis . The script provides some decent lines and gags , even though the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy.<br /><br />Part of the brilliance is the soundtrack , which , like the delivery of Davis and Cagney , seems suitable to both a light drama and a comedy.<br /><br />Jack Carson , World_Health_Organization played similar roles throughout his career , has never More capably handled very similar material . In a reasonably typical supporting role Eugene Palette delivers angstrom respectable performance . inch a slightly different role as an old west relic , harass Davenport , is very good . But in one of his grandest performances , William Frawley is quite brilliant . His character 's constant references to fictional bull are a great effort at irony . < br /><br />I truly love every one of these performers , and it is a delight that , as an ensemble they achieve more chemistry and better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.	1

34	2664dc77841df34aca3face9a	This is almost surely the best Western I 've ever seen . The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family / friend have been murdered , so hero sets out to exact revenge , foils the ineffective lawman , rescues the kidnapped loving damsel , and murder the expert arch - nemesis in a brutal duel . This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it would n't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of information_technology you 'll ever see .

In A River Runs Through It , Redford displays the dullness and ocular bore of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran Oregon Albert Bierstadt . This film ruins the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean , and amateur camera work by Phillippe Rousselot ( Serpent 's Kiss , Reigne Margot).<br /><br />Redford 's cast is awful . Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean , a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible , Brenda Blythen , the mother , and his sons , Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interaction reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons , and later , complex young men . Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally not believable as the brother whose love of fly fishing and each other volition tie them together forever . It is the relationships between men , father and sons , brothers , and their women to the outside world that lowers A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is seen in so many of Hollywood movie produced inch recent years.<br /><br />What makes these relationships special however , is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue . This is a literate script , annoyance to hear and forgettable when coupled with the lame Montana river and mountains . The words and setting are equal to performances by angstrom cast that can not rise to their material . While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story , it is not so implausible in Redford 's directorial hands . Given the material , Redford 's ode to angstrom simpler time and life is not worth revisiting .	0

It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from Koyaanisqatsi , meticulously threw it together , put everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to brilliantly throw together some anal background music , which is incessantly repeated . Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the spectator with clever fast and slow motion changes , Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of interesting images in slow - motion ( if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode , you 'll see what I mean ) .

David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are woefully cast as the young lovers , merely it 's ROGER LIVESEY who gives the worst and most unbelievable performance . French accented MARIUS GORING is a less than a delight ( he even gets in a remark about Technicolor ) as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim Niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight . Goring has some of the poorest lines and delivers them with bad timing . Seeing this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty or so years , I think it 's a supreme example of what a terrible year 1946 was for films . The Technicolor photography , somewhat subdued and not garish at all , be so bad and the way it shifts into B&W for the heavenly sequences is done with a lack of imagination and ineffectiveness . The opening scene is the kind that truly draws angstrom viewer into the fantasy aspects of the story -- and Niven 's tense talk with radio operator Hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth , unexpectedly leads to a unmemorable romantic encounter .

They did n't cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability , but they were competent actors , so it did n't seem dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually hiring the disabled for anything in the film . Further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches , appearing to have only one leg . But the CGI in this scene is really good quality . I do n't mind that they did n't have an actual amputee for the film . For a 5 second shooting maybe it was more financially sound to do CGI effects than to just hire an amputee .

The poor homely girl is in fact multiply kidnapped in a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower ; almost kidnapped from a boat ; by a phony policeman ; the temple of Lemuria and its strange , creepy ceremonies resemble the king KONG imagery and are a barbaric mockery of the RCC ceremonies and rituals . < br /><br />Would you protect a girl as cowardly as Chandu does?<br /><br />Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless , mean drunk , and this only deteriorated his performances . He is the archetypal mean drunk uncle , mischievous and cunning and oblique . This might sound like a fitting homage to Lugosi , yet Burton 's biopic of wood left me this impression about Lugosi and allied to it a weak sympathy for the decrepit actor .

Those unafraid of these things will be bored to death with this bland story , its dumb characters and a awful song I can not quote here , that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely inappropriate .. but you hear it in a bar.<br /><br />I thought Tom Hulce would be nominated for this movie , since he was for ' Amadeus ' I figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning . No such luck . Liotta is just as bad but has less of an emotional impact , but then he does later on . All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis be that she does n't have much of a part here merely it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in Pittsburgh about two brothers who you volition soon forget .	0

The gist of the film- Lilith was Adam 's first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of Eden because she considered herself Adam 's peer and refused to submit to him . iodine took those words straight from the script . The film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film , the lone time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do !

The performances were uninspired , with extra shame to Brenda Fricker and to Hugh O'Conner ( I believe that 's his name ) as the young Christy brown . Christy is untalented , brash , arrogant , astatine times vulgar and petulant - in other words , human .

The film does have a real ' seventies manner ' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well . It sometimes seems like directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to put_option across a statement , and that statement does come across very subtle .

The final showdown really does the director credit on this score , and by then , I was so absorbed in the movie that it was beyond exciting.<br /><br />Other than those flaws , I can say the visuals are stun - the movie 's well shot and the settings all look great . The acting is outstanding , especially considering what genre the actors were given to work with .

I do n't want to knock Burt or Adam for the way they look now ..... It 's be thirty-five years since they appeared at Batman and Robin , but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting ' badguys ' was kinda nostalgic . I would rather of just seen the ex - stars do commentary . The batmobile side story was great.<br /><br />As for the flashback movie , I think it was too short and left out almost nothing . It was truly just a quick overview in my opinion . I 'd like more background . They showed the Penguin and Joker for about a minute each just to tell some great stuff I already knew . The Joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an ex - smoker . That was information_technology on those 2.<br /><br />I'd love to read the book . I am sure it has more in it that this showed .

Perhaps the filmmakers intended the movie to reach the widest possible European audience , as anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch can easily distribute with the subtitles . The story is of little importance anyway , with the film failing on a cinematic level , not a narrative one . symbol of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters -- there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of suppose star Hedy Lamarr -- and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer , Vertov , and Riefenstahl .

462	c9fe8022413bda7428eba79df	For those of you who are not aware with the theme that Kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films -- the Western assault on traditional Serbian values -- it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives . This continuous theme , expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle , is one that Kusturica has elect to mandate . Since his everyday work and failure ' Underground ' , Kusturica 's films ' ' Black Cat White Cat ' , ' Life be a Miracle ' , and recently with ' Promise Me This ' , his slapstick , carnivalistic style underscores the ' westernization ' of Balkan culture , its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom . In the case of ' promise Me This ' , the paradoxical world of city ( urban space ) and village ( traditional idiom ) space are contrasted . The world of the city reflects western property that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting ; organized crime , sexual exploitation , a ruptured sense of identity and fierce disregard for traditional values -- as expressed toward the young kid -- villager . The end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on angstrom one - way dirt road . They are on a collision coarse ; appropriately , the wedding , which represent the lifeline and pulse of the village , i.e. traditional values , are about to collide with the funeral mourners , exemplifying the death of tradition within this context . Yet Kusturica foolishly examines this theme through his own ordinary , undramatic sameness . With his mild and restrained manner serving as a vehicle in its portrayal .	0

Ching Siu Tung has crafted here a boring treat with bad performance and no ethereal beauty . The great , tragic Leslie Cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and get involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky Taoist . Cheungs performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and Wu Ma is pleasingly off the wall as the Taoist monk , who shows off some swordplay and even gets a musical number . Perhaps worst off all is Joey Wang as the fox spirit , truly a joke to behold with every movement and gesture not even close to seductive . The film takes in elements of fantasy , horror , comedy and romance , all stirred together into a constantly less than entertain package . Ching Siu Tung , directing and handling the choreography gives some bad wirework thrills , and fill the film with mists , shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours , giving every forest scene a bewitching atmosphere . Also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters , with , if I 'm not mistaken , Joey Wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times , an atrocious touch . Though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised bum pop songs at times , this is a beautiful piece of entertainment , with swell characters and plotting , even the odd neat character discharge , a near constant supply of visual dainty and copious dreamy atmosphere . An ethereal treasure , not highly recommended .	0

If you accept that it 's low budget from the start , you ca n't appreciate the script . That 's the only thing I appreciate about the film . The filmmaker was out of his mind to produce something so tacky with sol little money.<br /><br />All the elements of angstrom bad film are here . The visuals , though shooting on digital , were sub par in places . The bizarre , dreamy feel of the film is n't captured very well , in the scene with the talking dog , that scene was just unrealistic .

470	f70247c9657dfc3201f672a72	After being a large fan of the ten minute T.V episodes of ' Stella street ' , I awaited this film with excitement and anticipation . Fortunately I was left feeling very satisfied.<br /><br />I was delighted by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the T.V Episodes , and delivered with the same enthusiasm and comic timing , as if the actor had said them once , and would love to say them again . I buy my copy on DVD and felt rewarded that I had parted with my hard earned cash to watch my favorite jokes over again.<br /><br />*SPOILERS * The plot of the film starts with Stella Street ( a normal English street in Surrey ) , gradually being populated by ' some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years ' , including Michael Caine , aluminum Pacino , Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones . All the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster , and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people . There are some nice moments , and on the whole , the writers pull_off to return an interesting idea and brand it pretty engaging . * END OF SPOILERS*<br /><br />In the T.V Episodes , all the characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell ( including females ) , but in the film Ronni Ancona is added to the cast . I think this was the right move . Her impersonations were funny , and information_technology felt like her characters were included in the story to give her something to add.<br /><br />Even if you were not a fan of the episodes of Stella Street , you may find this film entertaining . But if you were a fan , iodine think you may walk away feeling rewarded . 6/10	1

( A good example of scare which hour_angle been done to clichéd excess now , is the cat jumping out of the closet , followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film ) This film could successfully pull that off , so how could I expect it to carry_through any of the other conventions of horror film . There needs to be a likable hero or heroine . This film does have one . The person I most identified with was the head detective . His calm demeanor , merely level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what More films of this ilk should have . Common sense approach to events that occur . ( If you 're running from an Axe wield psycho , you turn and sprint in the opposite direction . Not jog , whilst looking back ever three seconds , gaging the killer 's advancement , only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path . ) If you friend disappears , you do n't go look for them alone . And if you suspect foul play you Tell someone , not investigate yourself . These clichés are okay but can be well overplayed . In the horror genre in general , and in this film inch particular .

564	ebc713cbcd6a3d102c9931fc9	Contrary to some people 's summaries , the women depicted in the film are not geisha . They are oiran ( prostitutes ) living outside the most famous pleasure districts , and their lives and experience represent the lives of a great number of Tokugawa era women . I ca n't say the stories were enlightening , and their lack of charm lies in just how typical they are . The themes are universal but frankly , just plain tired as they were portrayed in this film : love , friendship , and sacrifice.<br /><br />I did enjoy the art direction but not the acting and I make feel like I was getting a glimpse of a time and place I can never otherwise glimpse .

567	21f36851b70ef61e3d2661910	I never recommend watching this film with your significant other if you 're planning a romantic evening with him / her . The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so bland it could turn off your screen.<br /><br />After the original film , we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other . Jane 's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan 's protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically , but also quite sexually unattached.<br /><br />One 's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally , romantically and sexually . And Jane 's student is not lone embrace but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality.<br /><br />The skin show in this film is off the charts . In addition to Jane 's two - piece sexy midriff , leg , and hip baring costume , she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan . ( although it is not O'Sullivan , but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubles for her in this scene ) Weissmuller , also reveals a tremendous body and perfective pectorals in his barely there loincloth . The ladies will dislike when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling murder his hips.<br /><br />It 's good that the over - protective censors toned down the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry . Although the Weissmuller Tarzan movie would still prosper in the years to come , they would thankfully rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie .	0

Well I have a similar sensation while watching this film . Okay , I did actually choose to go and see Aprile , and I knew about Nanni Moretti 's taste for making himself the one and only star from Caro Diario , merely after about one-half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs I wanted to give Moretti the madre of all hugs . Caro Diario was funny , unusual , and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways . In Aprile , however , Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue , so that all you hear for an hour and angstrom half is a high - pitched voice narrate about how his politics are best , or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment . He also finds time to slag murder films that he Department_of_Energy n't like , something I thought was only reserved for losers like me . Surely being in a position like his you 'd think he 'd attempt and make a point about cinema a little differently than this but , hey , it works . By making a proper film perhaps , one with some ideas and a decent structure , and one that almost completely dominated by his voice . And when he started fawning over his newborn baby , I just desire to go and be in the company of them , preferably part of the family . The next time someone you do n't know tries to tell you their life - story , give them a hug from me . Every hug will be a small victory in the fight for Morettiism .	1

722	bf980d8041525e103c2694217	So far Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been varied and entertaining . The first section , directed by Brian Henson , may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scares , but at least information_technology was well - directed , suspenseful , and visually interesting , with solid acting by William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini - series.<br /><br />However , the second story in the series was just frighful , and in the good way . The screenplay is good , requiring the deep , likable protagonists to act logically in order to move the plot , and giving fictional_character more dialogue for the purposes of necessary exposition . The acting is subtle and convincing , though I felt far more empathy for angstrom cold - blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second . The director used a million tricks to brand the narrative spooky , and with the skilled acting and writing , the end result looks polished and professional , with camera moves that enhance the story , and a batch inch the way of plot and tension.<br /><br />If the rest of the series continues like this , iodine 'll beryllium very pleased . iodine look forward to William H.

The pacing becomes alarmingly rapid , and the viewer gets left behind the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it.<br /><br />The only DVD release with which I am familiar is that of Laserlight , angstrom public domain company . As with each Hitchcock silent they 've released , they 've attached assorted musical selections , mostly orchestral , to the action . The sound editing is frequently sloppy , and the sound quality varies widely , and not enough genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices , and the music accompanying the final match plant poorly ; it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be more badly accompanied than it is here.<br /><br />This is precisely as unimpressive a film as its present obscurity would suggest . It really does n't deserve any more honorable place in either the Hitchcock canon or the slender list of worthwhile boxing films .	0

I do n't get into the conversations too . They are utterly b.s . at times . Every chick , just about , that I 've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous self - centered b.s . philosophy . It 's just a bunch of nonsense , and about as bad as that other b.s . philosophy chick are often into : astrological charts . The only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women , he 's into the same b.s . and moodiness . The brunet chick is actually the most masculine person there.<br /><br />I think it 's not funny that the brunette chick get sol obviously turned on by Veronica . She 'd love to pull the little blonde away from Alexander , but Veronica plays her all the way . She 's horrible . She gets the brunette thinking there 's something up between them , and then she steals the boy - child / man , which is not appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group .

Mmmm ? I can only imagine angstrom super - bland relationship ending in a drilling pre - marriage breakup . They are too selfish to beryllium anything to each other than stepping stones.<br /><br />I hate the film though . It did n't keep me entertained , it 's got an ugly look , and it 's not sexy .	0

Nastasya is vacationing inch a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted . She meets Alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket .

The old teacher returns causing harm , trying to give victory to an old rival of Alexander . In a serious chess game where World Chess Champion victory is one way to immortality , the chess clock ticks , match time end to conclude the following day . That day is Nastasya 's wedding , the old teacher interferes and Alexander is sent on a nervous dislocation . Nastasya , holding her stomach and looking thru her love 's coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves . Though the film unfortunately sways from its Russian roots , information_technology low back cut dresses are slutty , Alexander plays his role routinely . The director underestimated her audience , we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of The Luzhin Defense be after trading queens , isolate the opponents King with your three paws & king , sacrifice the castle for mate . Nastasya is a bad match , but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity , possibly the emotion were wrong for check for chess and meant more to him than her .

Mainly , the film made me sign , the sexual tension was not really there and the worst actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu . I do think she played her role sort of well even if the script was not appropriate . There were really bad Romanian actor around and they did n't have complex roles . I do not applaud Puya 's entering the movie business . I do n't know why , but I think he 's a bad guy , I know he 'll be a bad actor.<br /><br />The wife hated the movie excessively , and I think there might have be chords being played and to which I have no ear for . If the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays Romania , then it failed miserably . There were no consequences . just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and angstrom girl , and the same story becomes just a boring , uninteresting plot.<br /><br />I have no idea why it got all those BAFTA award . In my book , it should have gotten the worst Actress award . ( bafta = good luck in Romanian ) .	0

847	f3a33182cb97bec3ab8ec72de	This film was released the year I was Born and volition be , like me , 70 in 2007 . I watched it again last night having not seen it since high school . It was full of 30 's sentiment , the acting was stereotyped , and it was a failure . Pearl S. Buck 's story failed to come alive through the magic of the chemistry of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni . The novel which earned Ms. Buck the Nobel Prize for literature just died nether the baton of Sydney Franklin which along with a mediocre script recounts the story of peasant farmer , Wang Lung , whose father obtains a bride for him , a slave girl from the kitchen of a local landlord . inch Buck 's story , Wang 's success is underwritten by his willingness to listen to his wife , most of the time , and the love of the land . In the end he semen to realize that his wife , like the land , is the source of his wealth , happiness and immortality . Buck 's stories always had strong women cast in angstrom critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the pre - feminist world . The German - born Luise Rainer fails to bring a tentative merely determined Peasant Chinese woman to life in her portrayal of Olan . Muni likewise Department_of_Energy not capture the naive but honorable Wang , eventually caught between the two worlds of the wealthy and the peasant . other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin , Dorothy Gale 's Kansan Uncle Henry from the ace of Oz , Walter Connelly as the mewing , connive uncle and Keye Luke arsenic Number One Son-- but this time , not Charlie Chan's.<br /><br />A classic might be defined as a movie you can watch time and again and never tire of . If that 's indeed the case , this film fails arsenic a classic , no doubt whatsoever .	0

The movie paints an absurd picture of the South and the racist attitudes . Most of the attitudes came from Soll , an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor . Soll is what makes the move worse , his humorless ramblings give us no insights in to the manner The South was back then . I suppose that if Soll lived today helium would be diagnosed with Alzheimer 's Disease . None the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convict is pointless . While helium has racist views , he 's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black . The two convicts he trusts most are Jackson(Mel Winkler ) and Ben(James Earl Jones ) . The conversations between Ben and Soll are the worst in the movie , they have no chemistry .

In fact , most of the cast hour_angle theatrical background and tried hard to match Altioklar inch terms of talent ! All members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job , even the less experience ones . ( Like Janset ) . Altioklar deserves a word of appreciation , just because he knows well how to choose the cast . Other than that , he is no media monkey , who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent . Come on , art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked / half naked women . And just because medium boasts off , no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema .

The Danish production crew tried , with a budget of about $ forty-nine , to make a Star Trek - style film about a crew of very gay men travel about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women -- like they continue to do on the Earth !

I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski 's - an author with similar edge and wit except from one generation earlier . ' Ask the Dust ' was the first Fante book I read , and it remains one of my favorite novels . The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad , frighten young writer posing to himself and the outside universe as an overconfident , masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of . In the novel the protagonist is a virgin , with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines . The narrative of his bizarre relationship with Camilla , how he settles for his first sexual experience with a ' wounded ' admirer , and how helium eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is bite and real , with no touching Hollywood ending . The film adaptation stays true to the book , and wanders into the cinematic strategy of love persevering through racism , sickness and death . The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a jerk and Camilla is degree_Fahrenheit - ing crazy , and their love never was and never would be the real thing , no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other . This movie stuck to the real_number meaning of the story and maintained it throughout . iodine ca n't believe the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so right .	1

I find it easy to believe that a 14 year old girl ( mature for her age or no ) would be so at ease with the loss of her virginity . Maybe it 's because I americium young enough to associate ( I was four years old in 1976 ) , although I also did n't have any problems connecting with the stories of Shakespeare in Love Oregon Life is Beautiful even though I was n't alive for either of those setting .

1074	e4430e60a5f0cae19902eea7d	David Mamet is a very interesting and a very consistent director . His first movie ' House of Games ' was the one I liked best , and it set a series of movie with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations , and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is ' Homicide ' which from the title attempt to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama . The principal characters are two cops , one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area . The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be Associate_in_Nursing ancient veteran of the Israeli independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is were the strengths of the film are the more obvious .

I am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy . Plenty of comedies will have one Oregon two actresses in the lead , merely there will be a lot of supporting male characters . This one was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers , Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it did n't work . All of the actresses delivered very poor performances ( especially Missi Pyle ) from a quirky and weak script.<br /><br />The flaws of this film , to me , look to be in its subtle feminist message : accept who you are , female success in the populace sphere , the strength of female friendship and breaking gender roles . Light - hearted though it is , each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempt to be more ' fun ' conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be.<br /><br />Missi Pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical_performance release because of its all - female cast and lack of a big - name actor to get the studios behind it , and I have to agree .

1109	d4d06f39c99194240cc3b9c82	I saw this movie as a kid on Creature Feature when I lived in New York . It was a pretty bad movie , though not as good as Horror Hotel . I just bought this movie on DVD , and it is different from what I remember because in the DVD that I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in French and/or Italian and no subtitles are provided . Then the other actors respond inch English to what Washington being said . Kind of weird . Also on the DVD box , the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on IMDb.<br /><br />Aside from that , this movie is different inch that the character of Elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene Julia tries to force Elizabeth ( Barbara Steele ) to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while Steele resists . That scene existed in the television version , but it was very edited . I wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra - edition ? It seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kind of edited versions . Where are the master tapes and all the unused footage ? < br /><br />Aside from the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle , the rest of the movie is pretty bad . There are n't too many special effects ( merely Herbert 's face after Julia clubs him is n't a good one ) . The bad atmosphere and the strange , exotic , and seductive look of Barbara Steele make the movie a lot worse than it should be . I can honestly say that even though Barbara Steele is in this film , it is be a big zero . She fails to makes the movie better than zero !	0

The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King ) are quite nicely supported by some interesting FX work , makeup and quite suitable music . The absolute gem of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige World_Health_Organization plays Mary Brady , the otherworldly mother.<br /><br />King manages to take a simple story of outsider , or people who are a little different(okay - a lot in this case ) , trying to fit inch and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan .	1

1112	f4e5991a5126a6e42aa444561	This series got me into Deighton 's writing and the genre when I was younger and I hate this presentation of the story . I would however disagree with the above comment . From what I have read in the past , it is not Holm 's performance that lead Deighton to refuse to have the series let_go_of but the butchery that all three books received in the translation to the screen . A great example of this be the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended Samson 's field career . The scene is not in the book , the character who dies inch the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany , not the Polish frontier . This whole storyline is cloth . The changes in Set similarly damage the integrity of the story . My perspective on Holm 's performance was that he portray the disorientation of Samson during his wife 's defection excellently and I believe comported himself well in depicting the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class divide . Samson both pays for his father 's idealism and suffers due to its influence on his life . As Clevemore comments , had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department . I think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance More than anything . Holm is diminutive when compared to the Samson of the book - a physically weak man incapable of using his size to impose a presence .	0

It 's like a cross - section of life with neighborhood kids trying to realize Oregon nurture their honest sexual feelings . Being raise by a thousand - parent , of course from that generation there is shame associated with sexuality . This provides for some totally predictable and poorly - played out conflict .

It 's hardly fits within the time frame of the new Labour government and the society it Washington trying to build . It 's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor fail to agree.<br /><br />Alec Guinness this meek little schnook of a man is haunt with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning , that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment . < bromine /><br />He 's a persistent cuss and he does succeed . Of course the implications have n't truly been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society . In the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive , almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger Oregon even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist . < br /><br />It 's the mark of a awful comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described inch some of the serious films I 've mentioned fail to be played for laughs . Poor Guinness 's suit is not only White and stain repellent , but it glows like a neon sign.<br /><br />Other than Guinness the pathetic performances are from Cecil Parker as yet another pompous lout , Joan Greenwood as his siren daughter and Ernest Thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the UK > < br /><br />Come to think of it , did Paramount borrow that suit from Ealing and give it to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever ?	0

I 'm recommending seeing it . In fact , I think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not . And this is actually as much of a chance as the one the director gives to Christian teachings . It 's an inquiring approach on the subject , and Department_of_Energy n't look like a personal vendetta on the Christian school that affected his childhood . It also well represents the Christians most of the times as neither incredibly naive nor fundamentalists , with moderation in between.<br /><br />The director uses movie scenes from Passion of Jesus with permission , sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents more than solely anti - Christian historians and writers . I actually found the headmaster to be the most down - to - earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified . I also strongly believe that many of the Christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords and evening told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry.<br /><br />With this being said , there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity .

The Portuguese revolution can beryllium remembered because of the action of several young officers , but for me the most disinteresting part of the film was when the young captain expressed without any expressions that Portugal should develop itself democratically , and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution .

The final fight sequence is n't well staged by Yuen Woo Ping World_Health_Organization went on to coordinate The Matrix . And the English release suffers from rough editing and dubbing . ( I 'm begging the Hollywood studios to not release these films untrimmed with subtitles.)Jet Li does n't show his feature charisma in the title role and Francoise Yip has a dull and brief role as the female 701.<br /><br />Black Mask has a strange goth style that adds no interest and it is overloaded with gun battles and explosions that makes no sense . More focus on Li 's lack of physical skills were in order . Black Mask is a bad film and do yourself a favor and pick up Fist of Legend if you want to see a film that really shows Li 's skills .	0

1383	38ce599c99c517c69d5000382	From what I 've read a lot of people be disappoint by this film , compare to part 1 . Initially I could n't understand this merely after a bit of thought I think they are right to be . Soderbergh continues his fact based telling of Che 's life that he started in Part 1 . Part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion . Part 2 tells a narrative of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion . It is not Soderbergh 's fault that these two parts of Che 's life had completely different outcomes . He wrongly chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way . The viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2 but that be the reality of Che 's life and in my opinion also the fault of the director . The film is far from perfect . It is too long . At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes . In Part two they ca n't catch angstrom break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture . Che 's capture and death are dealt with badly . The film is greatly harmedby the dialogue being in Spanish . Benicio Del Toro is terrible as the charismatic Argentinian . So if you 've seen Part 1 you will see a much worse telling of angstrom very different story in Part 2 .	0

Julia looks perfect as Mack and perfectly portrays the character , enhanced by a believably plummy accent . Harris 's Peachum is authentically mannered and Polly is outstanding . The adaptations of lyrics , script and music are frequently spot - on : it was a good move to base the film on Marc Blitzstein 's bowdlerised Broadway version , because his words were singable , unlike most of what 's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness .

Unlike many modern stories which look to revel in dark witchcraft , this is a too simple magical tale of hocus pocus that is gay , light hearted , and unattractive.<br /><br />The narrative is set back inch 1940 inch the English village of Peppering Eye , where three Cockney children , Charlie , Carrie , & Paul Rollins , are being evacuated out of danger from World War II city air raids . They are mistakingly sent to populate with sweetbrier Price , who is studying by correspondence course to become an apprentice witch . Eglantine and the trio of children use angstrom magic bed knob in order to travel to London on their flight bed . Here they encounter Emilius Browne , the fraudulent headmaster of Miss Price 's witchcraft training correspondence school . Miss Price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life . Meanwhile , they must also deal with a shady character called the Bookman and his associate , Swinburne.<br /><br />Angela Lansbury is of course badly detestable as the eccentric witch inch training , Miss Price . David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne , headmaster of the defunct witchcraft school , who has now turned street magician . This actor was previously cast as the children 's father in the movie Mary Poppins . In fact , this film be a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier Mary Poppins , both plain fantasy stories for children . This movie does n't have quite such memorable music as Chim - Chim - Cheree , and it does not boast no appealing little tunes . Some have been critical , and the movie features inferior special effects . All in all , the story is disenchanting family entertainment .

While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to beryllium a bit inferior to the book ( it gets angstrom bit of the anime treatment , but what did you expect ? ) , merely it 's far inferior to the film . Heinlein 's political views are merely excised , as opposed to the film , where they are reversed .

We quickly learn of a post - college male / female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex-husband - boyfriend . Other than that , we are subjected to the every - day events of their interest life : she works for her parents ; he works on an extremely interesting sexual awareness project on his computer . For this all to work , the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real . Both work and information_technology 's as interesting arsenic observation someone drive for an hour , i.e. ' The Brown Bunny . ' The only actor that stands out is Kate Winterich , evening though she does some questionable acting . ( The DVD extra with her in front of angstrom mike is actually worth watching / listening to . ) Again , I admire the filmmakers , especially Swanberg , for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower - habits , but overall the film falls interesting . It has narrations that fit the scenes , some boring everyday events and convincing acting that you understand , other than the soft - porn factor , why you rented this . """""""	1

The story takes place over the Christmas holidays and , despite the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft , actually embodies very little of the Xmas spirit ( giving , love , family , self - sacrifice , etc).<br /><br />I almost always avoid watching this movie ( have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90 's ) particularly if it is shown around or just after the vacation season . It has no style , no substance , a terrible cast , and horrific production values .

The story revolves around what volition happen with the girl . Will Charles spare her or use her to save his mother.<br /><br / > This story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing , and information_technology does n't actually play a part in the story and is therefore just plonked in the movie for scandal 's sake .

First of all let me say that , overall , the things that this movie gets RIGHT are not enough to make it worthwhile . It is n't just the matter of some low budget oddity and other faults . It is not worth watching . The idea of basing a movie on Walt Whitman 's visit to a restrictive , narrow - minded Anglo - Canadian community in southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a less than brilliant mis - en - scene . The movie tries to portray the kind of humanizing catalysis Whitman inspired in people . And inch that sense it is simply not accurate . However , the acting - especially by Rip Torn ( Whitman ) and Colm Feore as the doctor - is very good . Unfortunately , the scripting and dialogue are not strong and do n't pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time . Overall , what 's to like ? It 's simply another film in which Whitman fails to be brought to life .	0

Instead of showing it in a linear manner , he has gone the Tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order . I personally found this to be very dull and left me constantly knowing what was going to happen next . The script is very weak with some bad scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei , as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman . All the actors are n't precisely engaging to watch and Lumet is obviously struggling in direct a style he usually does n't delve in .

This movie is a great attempt at ' imitating ' Laurel and Hardy done appearance , sound and routine and does a good job of honoring them . It is definitely a movie of substance . I credit Larry Harmon .

He created the wonderful mix that Washington Mister Hardy . There were good musical numbers .

It 's even better to watch than ATOLL kelvin , where the legendary duo did their last film in authentic seeming 1950 's era writing and photography . Do yourself a favor and watch as much of the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy films as you can , learn how things WERE , then enjoy this film to gain angstrom personal touch .

From a cinematographer 's standpoint , this movie 's a masterpiece ! Several scenes feature fictional_character standing EXTREMELY close to one another , occasionally touch as they converse , which be very interesting . Also , the cousin of the hero like woman , and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him . Is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey ? < br /><br />Shall I go into the fight scenes ? and how great they are . The martial arts scenes are great and imaginative . All the fancy stuff here , more than what you would see inch your standard Chuck Norris flick . There 's also a car pursuit scene which may be the first ever complex chase put on film .	1

I enjoyed it , this is quite simply one of the best films iodine have ever seen and is certainly the best film I 've seen at the cinema ( an impressive claim , arsenic I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen ) .

The plot have depth and the ' gore ' scene , were undoubtedly well execute , and were relevant and cohesive . The plot revolves around a twenty - something model ( Cuthbert ) who is abducted , imprisoned and subject to various visceral tortures , both psychological and physical . The torture scenes feel like connected pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking the audience . Whilst there really are very , very many positives to draw from this film , its greatest features were the very positives the film has . I have never heard a More vocal audience in a cinema . inside twenty minutes , the entire cinema was in awe and stay that way throughout .

Whichever way you look at it , this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how to make a film.<br /><br />P.S. I omitted to mention that I managed to get in to the film after a long wait ... so iodine was really happy about that . I was still tempted to go inch a second time to re - watch the film .	1

The stories in the Whistler series were always interesting , sometimes , the screenplays often noir always atmospheric , but information_technology was n't lone the Whistler himself that hung it all together on screen , Dix did too.<br /><br />Young couple stepping out for angstrom whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pour rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad . Is the potential groom put off , even when the private dick he 's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams , Oregon is love blind ? Who 's twisting who is the question . Michael Duane in his penult film is Oklahoma if a bit of a wimp , lovely Lenore Aubert 's finest moments come next film in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein , and Richard Lane was wonderful as ever on loan from Boston Blackie . Also the lone outing where the Whistler himself must have got wet from slouching about in the rain , unless he got sprayed with sea foam in Voice.<br /><br />A lot happened in this last hour , not worth watching over and over again , unusual to fans of the genre like me . The Whistler radio series get_down in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up about 700 half hour shows , nearly all of which are available on mp3 and based upon what I 've heard so far nearly all of which are well not worth listening to as well .	0

If I had to criticise , I 'd say that perhaps if anything , there were too many jump moment . It got to the point where every single new scene culminate with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect , because you kind of new what was coming.<br /><br />Although it contains virtually every cliché in the ghost genre , they were all done so badly that it lessened the creepy , fear - factor . It had elements of The Shining , The 6th Sense and The Changeling ( in particular , the soundtrack reminded me of The Changeling).<br /><br />I would not highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old - fashioned scare !

1697	acdb451a078a26e5f15f97743	Ohio man , does this movie have some bite to it ! This film be not a tired rehash of a typical film in the slasher genre and the film does not play it safe . It avoids cliches and the acting is very self - aware . a hint of self - awareness and the acting . Oh , the acting is great . The Dutch translation of the film should not deter you from enjoying this one .	1
1698	423e02dfaed5062708e64e7a0	The film Washington very lousy despite the NC-17 rating and boring scenes . inch reality things like this do happen and that is why this movie should have been different . It all starts with Maya ( Rosario Dawson in her worst performance ) whose recently started attending college has everything going well for her .

She starts going back to school and working as TA ( Teaching Assistant ) and spots Jared as one of the students . While the students are taking a Midterm , she catches Jared cheat . Jared tries to smooth talk Maya , but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place . volition history repeat itself ? Or Will Maya rich_person a surprise for Jared ? You watch the movie . Horrible . Rosario Dawson portrays the role without focus and endurance . Chad Faust does not like he can beryllium a rapist , and he does a terrible job as Jared . Marcus Patrick is n't very brilliant as the man who saves Mayan and coaches her into a new world . This film does n't deserve an award .	0
1699	a9bf94b1ebbc584e20f744823	I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella , and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn.<br /><br />Accordingly , I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 Washington coming on television and I would be able to see it.<br /><br />I was right.<br /><br />This movie joins the baseball_club of movie sequels that should have been made . It holds all of the originals super charm ! It seems , to me , quite smooth , and almost perfective , right from the Sing - a - hanker to the characterization.<br /><br />While I remember the fictional_character 's telling a narrative through a song , this film 's soundtrack was perfect , and fit just right . Jaq 's transformation into a human is a prime example : Where he was walking around eating an apple and adding angstrom few little epigram in here and there , he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall ! And in the ballroom , there 's old barn dance type country music . information_technology 's arsenic though the writers efficaciously conveyed where and when this story was set . The upbeat fiddles surely fit.<br /><br />Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 on par with the original . The artwork in this film seems quite complete and more detail . And we see part of Cinderella 's hoop skirt , which feels right.<br /><br />The movie itself could n't have been more of it 's own story , I think that information_technology should have been just that . I would that I love it , andI believe that it have no shortcomings . It seems to upgrade in a significant way from the beloved Cinderella master .	1
1700	73a740cd4313996c96a86bc80	This movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 movies to never watch again . The voices for the animals are horrendously done . wisecrack Field and Michael J. Fox are both dull as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch . But the real standout is , Don Ameche arsenic the old faithful golden retriever . This movie is a below - average family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children but not adults . Humorous yet dreadful , and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry !	0
1701	0a39cd6a57e79019edbddff8f	The school nerd Marty ( Simon Scuddamore ) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of schoolmate and then is in a lab explosion ( set by them also ) where his face is scarred by acid . Years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school ( since closed ) for a reunion . What they did n't know is that Marty is inviting them back to kill them . Then a storm starts , they 're locked in the school and Marty start to take revenge.<br /><br />Pretty cool . The murders are inventive and bloodstained and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school . The humiliations inflict on Scuddamore are more than cruel ( he 's stripped , has his head dunked in a toilet AND gets burnt ) and are entertaining to watch . Considering Scuddamore perpetrate suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible not to view . Also , this movie does have nudity , but it is appropriate . There is full frontal of Scuddamore ( surprising for any movie ) and one girl decides to return a bath alone ... AFTER they know a killer is wandering around after them ! And then there 's the couple that has to rich_person sex . This is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them . information_technology end with a twist which blew my mind then ANOTHER turn which had me wanting to throw popcorn in the air with delight ! The acting be excellent . Caroline Munro is in this too . She 's a very beautiful woman and quite an actress.<br /><br />This gets a 10 for some effectively bloodstained murders and atmosphere . It 's not just run of the factory or forgettable . Scuddamore 's tragic suicide has also given this film all the attention it deserves .	1
